The aim is to survey different softwares that are available off the shelf to build efficient surrogates. 

The conditions provided are - 

"This can include LLM, but not limited to it. (i) commit framework (2) define optimality, (3) software efficient surrogates."


Available Softwares include off the shelf and various packages that are used to develop surrogate models. (https://rdcu.be/c5Ri9)

1. Surrogate Modelling Toolbox - python , matlab (MATSuMoTo, SUMO)
2. Astraea (CAE)
3. Volupe (simcenter star - ccm+)
4. surfpack 
5. surrogate modelling assistant software ( CEUR-WS)
6. AI surrogate models LDRD (PHASM) - Prof, this I found very close to what we are trying to aim for.
